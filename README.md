# Anomaly detection of faulty sensors in a network using PCA 


This repo is to develop a fault detection system for a sensor network measuring air pollutants and to localize online the faulty sensor. The technique applied here is based on the machine learning tool of principal component analysis, which enables localization and detection of faulty sensors based on available data collected from 6 locations around the city of Nancy, France.

##  Data Description
The dataset for this project is 2 CSV files:



The dataset is in 2 CSV files in the folder Data, # 1. training.csv  and # 2. validation.csv,
 each consisting of 18 rows. From the 6 locations, the first 3 rows correspond to measurements of ozone, nitrogen oxide, and carbon dioxide of the first location, repeated subsequently for the other locations

## Tools used in the project

The project was programmed in Python language
